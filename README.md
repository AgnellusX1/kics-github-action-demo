# ðŸ¤– KICS GitHub Actions Demo

This repository shows how KICS GitHub Action can be set and was fully inspired by the documentation on [KICS GitHub Actions Marketplace tutorial](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/kics-github-action#simple-usage-example).

- To check how the action was set, go to [.github/workflows/kics-scan=action.yml](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics-github-action-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/kics-scan-action.yml) file. 
   - You will see simple example of how to use KICS features in your GitHub Actions Pipeline.

- To check results examples, go to [Actions tab](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics-github-action-demo/actions) and select a workflow that is finished. 
   - You will see multiples failures! This is intended to generate outputs so you can check how KICS create *Annotations* and upload reports as *Artifacts* to be downloaded.

- Finally, go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics-github-action-demo/security) on [Code scanning alerts](https://github.com/Checkmarx/kics-github-action-demo/security/code-scanning) section and see how KICS uses sarif reports to generate scanning issues.
